TASK-02 at PRODIGYINFOTECH.

# Objective:
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

# K-Means Algorithm:
The k-means algorithm is a clustering method used to partition a dataset into k distinct, non-overlapping subsets or clusters. 

# 1.Data Preparation:
In k-means clustering, data preparation involves scaling and normalizing the features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations. This may include handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing the data.

# 2.Data Visualization:
Data visualization in k-means clustering typically includes plotting the data points and their corresponding cluster centers to visually assess the clustering results.

# 3.Selecting N Clusters based in Inertia in k means:
Selecting the optimal number of clusters (N) in k-means clustering using inertia involves evaluating how the sum of squared distances (inertia) changes as the number of clusters increases. The most common method for this is the Elbow Method.

# 4.Plotting Clusters:
From selecting optimal number of clusters we plotted it in 2D as well as 3D plots.

# Conclusion:

Cluster 1: Earning high but spending less

Cluster 2 : Average in terms of earning and spending

Cluster 3 : Earning high and also spending high (TARGET SET)

Cluster 4 : Earning less but spending more

Cluster 5 : Earning less , spending less
